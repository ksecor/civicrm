sf-upload
---------

DESCRIPTION

Batch release of SourceForge projects.

INSTALLATION

With a modern CPAN.pm (version > 1.8x) just type in the extracted
sf-upload directory:

    cpan .

Else, do:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make all test install

You need some perl module prerequisites, namely libwww, Crypt::SSLeay
and HTML::Parser. You can get the modules from http://www.cpan.org or,
better, fetch and install the modules automatically with

    perl prereqinst

If you're on Windows and you have ActivePerl installed, then you
should try instead

    perl prereqinst -ppm

Note that all installing actions ("make install" and "perl
prereqinst") should be executed as superuser.

USAGE

Create a configuration file named .sfuploadrc in your home directory.
Put your SourceForge user name and password to the file:

user = myusername
password = mypassword

If you do not put the password into the configuration file, then you
can specify the -password option in the command line (not
recommended), or you will be prompted interactively.

To upload a file and start the release process, just type:

    sf-upload -pr projectname -p packagename -r releasename -f file    

To see the complete list of options, type

    sf-upload -\?

The most common (source) file type are guessed by extension, otherwise
you have to set the -type option. Also, the processor type is by
default "Any" but can be changed with the -processor option.

For more information, refer to the man page (after installation) or by
using

    perldoc sf-upload
